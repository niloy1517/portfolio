Iâ€™m Niloy Gope, a dedicated Full-Stack Developer focused on the MERN Stack. I enjoy turning innovative ideas into scalable, high-performance web applications that offer smooth and intuitive user experiences.

My core skills include React.js for frontend, Node.js & Express.js for backend, and MongoDB for database management.

Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Diploma in Computer Science and Technology, where Iâ€™ve built a solid foundation in data structures, algorithms, and modern software development practices.

I'm constantly exploring new technologies, building projects from scratch, and striving to become better every day.

ðŸš€  (Updated)
I was always curious about the web, and my interest grew as I started building websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With time, I explored React + Vite, which helped me create faster and more dynamic applications. Frontend development became more than just a skill â€” it became my passion.




ðŸ”§ Backend Development Journey (English)
My curiosity to understand how websites work behind the scenes led me to backend development. I started with Node.js and Express.js, building RESTful APIs and connecting databases using MongoDB. Over time, I learned how to handle authentication, manage server logic, and ensure application performance and security. Backend development gave me a deeper understanding of how full-stack systems truly work.
